                The company specializes in municipal software, especially
                software for building departments. As a result, I have handled
                and managed large amounts of data, including converting
                data from new customers' old products into our database
                structure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the company is very small (fewer than 20 people), everyone
                does a bit of everything, so our days will often include customer
                phone calls, fixing bugs for existing software, and working on
                new features or software.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also created Municity Help, which acts as an internal ticket
                tracking and customer relationship management tool. It includes
                a customer portal for our users to report issues and ask
                questions. For more information about Municity Help, see the
                Projects section below.

              <p>
                Municity Help is the internal piece of the ticket tracking and CRM
                software that I created for Software Consulting Associates, Inc.
                It allows us to more easily respond to customer inquiries and
                issues by cutting down on phone traffic. It also allows the
                President of the company to more easily track customer invoices
                and development projects by consolidating all of our customer
                data into a single location.
              </p>
              <p>
                The software uses a HTML5/CSS3 front end and communicates with a
                Node.js server that authenticates all requests, logs them, and
                sends them to the custom MSSQL 2014 database, listens for a
                response, and sends the result back to the client.
